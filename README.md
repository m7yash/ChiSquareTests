# SupervisedMachineLearning
Two statistics programs that can be used in Supervised Machine Learning. Both **programs even show all work in the output**!

## How to Use
- On this repository's main page, click 'Code' and then click 'Download ZIP'
- For Linear Regression, use command line to run ```javac LinearRegression.java``` and then ```java LinearRegression``` in the downloaded folder
- For Chi Square, use command line to run ```javac ChiSquareTest.java``` and then ```java ChiSquareTest``` in the downloaded folder

## Linear Regression
Definition: Linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables.

Use in Supervised Machine Learning: The model will find the best fit linear line between the variables.

Note about Program: This includes both key statistics and a regression report. It can also extrapolate future values!

## Chi Square Test
Definition: A chi-squared test is a statistical hypothesis test that is valid to perform when the test statistic is chi-squared distributed under the null hypothesis.

Use in Supervised Machine Learning: Selects best features from given data set to obtain the best results.

Note about Program: This can do chi-square tests of two different types (one for goodness-of-fit and one for homogeneity/independence).
