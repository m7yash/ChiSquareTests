# Simple Linear Regression
Made this in high school to solve AP Statistics homework problems. Both programs show all work in the output.

## How to Use
- On this repository's main page, click 'Code' and then click 'Download ZIP'
- For Linear Regression, use command line to run ```javac LinearRegression.java``` and then ```java LinearRegression``` in the downloaded folder
- For Chi Square, use command line to run ```javac ChiSquareTest.java``` and then ```java ChiSquareTest``` in the downloaded folder

## Linear Regression
Definition: Linear regression is a linear approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables.

Note about Program: This includes both key statistics and a regression report. It can also extrapolate future values.

## Chi Squared Test
Definition: A chi-squared test is a statistical hypothesis test that is valid to perform when the test statistic is chi-squared distributed under the null hypothesis.

Note about Program: This can do chi-squared tests of two different types (one for goodness-of-fit and one for homogeneity/independence).
