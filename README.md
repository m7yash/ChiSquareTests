# SupervisedMachineLearning
Two statistics programs that can be used in Supervised Machine Learning. Both programs even show all work in the output!
## Linear Regression
Definition: Linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables.

Use in Supervised Machine Learning: the model will find the best fit linear line between the variables.

Note about Program: This includes both key statistics and a regression report. It can also extrapolate future values!

## Chi Square Test
Definition: A chi-squared test is a statistical hypothesis test that is valid to perform when the test statistic is chi-squared distributed under the null hypothesis.

Use in Supervised Machine Learning: Selects best features from given data set to obtain the best results.

Note about Program: This can do chi-square tests of two different types (one for goodness-of-fit and one for homogeneity/independence).
